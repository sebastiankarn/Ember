## Player Guide
The game is a work in progress and so far there are no insctructions in game of how to play. These will be added further on and quests will be clearer and guide new players to help them understand how to experience the world. Some systems are in place (like questing, enchanting, learning skills, etc.) but are not obvious how to use. Here are some quick tips:

### Movement and Interaction with Environment
You move your character by using right click. Right click enemies to start auto-attacking them, or other NPC's to interact with them. Some NPC's sell items like potions that can be used to recover health or mana. Press 'SPACE' to pick up loot and press 'M' to open the world map.

### Inventory
Items you loot, buy or get rewarded with from quests will be placed in your inventory. Press 'B' to open it. To equip an item or use a consumable, right click the item.

### Character Development
Press 'C' to open your character menu. Here you can go between tabs to see what you have equipped, make your character stronger by using skill points earned from leveling up and selecting which spells you want to augment to make your character unique. Talk to a Trainer in order to learn new spells.

When you have spells or consumables that you want to use in combat you can drag these into the action bar at the bottom of the screen and used by pressing '1', '2', '3', etc. Items can be dragged from the inventory ('I') and spells can be dragged from the spell menu ('K').

### Enchantment
Talk to an enchanter to enchant your eqiupment. Other items can be consumed with a probability to enchant a piece of equipment.
